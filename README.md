# Typing_speed_Improver
Hey Guys, I am Prathmesh Ghate here,  I am a Data Science and Python enthusiast.In this project I've made a Typing_speed_Improver. <br> 

I've developed this project using python. <br> 
The Idea behind this was kinda selfish as I wanted to improve my typing speed, I developed this project.<br> 
For the GUI stuff, I opted to use Tkinter.<br>
